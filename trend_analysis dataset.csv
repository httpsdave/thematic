BSCS,N/A,BOT SYSTEM PERCEPTION SIMULATOR FOR FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS USING BEHAVIOR TREES,2018,"This study focused on developing an artificial intelligence for an FPS (First Person Shooters) bot system equipped with perception capabilities using the idea of behavior trees instead of using FSM (Finite-state machines). It was used to analyze the concept behind the behavior trees. Whereas using an FSM for bot systems is another method for programming a bot, it was usually used on the earlier types of bots in FPS games. It is a method in which bots are following actions from a sequential list of commands within a given condition. It enables the bots to interact with the player through a pattern. But the disadvantage on using an FPS bot programmed with FSM is that, when it decides which actions to perform, it traverses all the other states from the list of commands sequentially, making its movements easy to predict and memorize. In this case it lessens the excitement and thrill that the players are looking for an FPS game. On the other hand, using a behavior tree involves defining the states of the bot listed on a hierarchical form. The bot can choose from the available list of commands for them to perform depending on the conditions set, without traversing all the states on the hierarchy. It gives an edge to the bot programmed using behavior trees over the bots programmed with FSM. This study was evaluated with the help of IT- professionals using the ISO 9126-1 quality model to assess the functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability of the FPS bot system programmed using behavior tree. From the evaluation conducted it was proven that behavior trees are suitable for programming an FPS bot.","CATHERINE A. CASTILLO, MIT"

BSCS,N/A,THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARTIST'S PORTFOLIO W/ MACHINE LEARNING,2022,"The researchers aimed to develop a website to create a platform for small local artists to create them a portfolio that contains their artworks, and they can express their skills and ideas to attract potential clients and increase their engagement and exposure. The researchers used Iterative methodology to develop the system because it can make iterations. The final product, which is still in development, will evolve from iteration to iteration until it is completed. The researchers decided to use survey and questionnaires to be distributed through google forms then evaluated the mean using The ISO 25010 Quality Model where the characteristics are the functional suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security, maintainability, and portability, and for the characteristics of the quality in use are the effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, freedom of risk and context coverage. On the other hand, the Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) where the characteristics are the Efficiency, Affect, Helpfulness, Control, and Learnability. The website's classifying function made with the use of Naïve Bayes Algorithm. A total of 370 datasets together with four classes (Acrylic Painting, Gouache Painting, Watercolor Painting, Digital Painting) were used for training. The researchers tested the algorithm based on confusion matrix that yields an accuracy score of 0.8991 or in percentage form 89.91%. Based on the conducted evaluation of the IT/CS professionals that was based on ISO/IEC 25010, the product quality of the website ranged from 89.6% for the quality of use. This proved that the Naïve Bayes Algorithm is suitable for the Portfolio text classification with the proven results, evaluating and testing.","MA. CONCEPCION R. REPALAM, MIT"
BSCS,N/A,MUSIC PLAYER APPLICATION SELF REGULATING VOLUME THROUGH RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM,2022,"The simple act of using a cell phone while driving can be dangerous, especially if the user utilized loud earbuds or headsets. In this regard, listening to the environment can be another issue to consider. The researchers proposed the decibel switch application to address the existing issues. The said application was made possible by the proponents by following the said objectives: to detect and classify external noise in the environment while using the application, to quickly monitor dangers, to conduct basic music player operations, and to make precise decisions on the fly. The Decibel Switch application that was developed provide an alternative solution that would address a problem that exists in the pedestrian community today. System capability was determined by analyzing the device and user needs. The algorithm of the recurrent neural network was utilized by the proponents for sound classification. The proponents of the study considered the use of mobile devices. At the same time, the device's hardware sensors and processor were also evaluated to conduct both music and sound classification. The software and hardware requirements for the user interface must both work at the same time for the application to work. By the end of the study, a system has been developed using a modified waterfall technique and has been evaluated by I.T. experts thus, obtaining a rating of 4.32 which means that the system developed is very good, because it met all the required criteria of a good and functional system.","REYMAR V.
